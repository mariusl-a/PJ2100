The website is heavily based on Modern UI by Microsoft. It was developed during our project weeks in PJ2100. 
The project won the "competition", and will become the library website for NITH.

The database and login information is no longer in use so I've left that in the code.

Hopefully this might be useful for someone curious about PHP, SQL and jQuery.
